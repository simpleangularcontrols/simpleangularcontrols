\n\nV.1.1.0\nBreaking Changes\n\nTag \"\" muss durch Tag \"\" oder Tag \"\" ersetzt werden.\nGrund ist, dass die Kompatibilität zu Reactive Forms nicht gewährleistet wurde und das bei Template Forms\nkeine Gruppierung der Formulare durch die Direktive \"ngModelGroup\" möglich war.\nWenn in einer Kompontene über @ViewChild auf die NgFormular Komponente zugegriffen wird, muss das Attribute auf dem Form auf folgenden Code\nangepasst werden '#myForm=\"NgFormular\"'.\n\nDas Property \"form\" in NgFormular ist neu Private. Auf \"form\" kann über die Methode \"getForm()\" zugegriffen werden.\n\n\nV.1.1.1\nBreaking Changes\n\nBeim Tag \"\" wurde das Property \"iconstyle\" in 2 Properties \"iconstyle\" und \"icon\" aufgeteilt. Werden die Standard Icons verwendet,\nmuss das Property von \"inconstyle\" auf \"icon\" umbenannt werden. Werden Custom Icons verwendet, muss das Sprite Set im Property \"iconstyle\" angegeben werden und\ndas Icon im Property \"icon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"getting-started - contributing","body":"\n                   \n\n﻿These packages are maintained and updated by exanic AG and jNetwork GmbH.\nThe packages may be used freely.
