An abstract service is available to ensure that all configurations are always available. When the library is updated, additional settings may need to be configured.\nChange settings project wide\nExample of an implementation of a project-specific configuration\nExample :import { SacAbstractConfigurationService } from '@simpleangularcontrols/sac-common';\n\nexport class CustomConfigurationService extends SacAbstractConfigurationService {\n  get LabelSizeLg(): number | null {\n    return 3;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeMd(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeSm(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXs(): number | null {\n    return 12;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXxl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n}The service must be defined in the application via the injection token SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE in the NgModule.\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    { provide: SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE, useClass: CustomConfigurationService },\n  ],\n  ...\n})Label below inputs\nTo display labels above the control, you must create a ConfigurationService in which the value 12 is defined for all LabelSize properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Injectable,

Custom Configuration\nThe default settings for the entire project can be defined via the ConfigurationService. An abstract service is available to ensure that all configurations are always available. When the library is updated, additional settings may need to be configured.\nChange settings project wide\nExample of an implementation of a project-specific configuration\nExample :import { SacAbstractConfigurationService } from '@simpleangularcontrols/sac-common';\n\nexport class CustomConfigurationService extends SacAbstractConfigurationService {\n  get LabelSizeLg(): number | null {\n    return 3;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeMd(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeSm(): number | null {\n    return 4;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXs(): number | null {\n    return 12;\n  }\n  get LabelSizeXxl(): number | null {\n    return 2;\n  }\n}The service must be defined in the application via the injection token SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE in the NgModule.\nExample :@NgModule({\n  ...\n  providers: [\n    { provide: SACCONFIGURATION_SERVICE, useClass: CustomConfigurationService },\n  ],\n  ...\n})Label below inputs\nTo display labels above the control, you must create a ConfigurationService in which the value 12 is defined for all LabelSize properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Injectable,

The common library, the Bootstrap-specific library and the demo project for the specific Bootstrap version.\nThe logic of the controls is to be implemented in the common library. It does not contain any definitions about the rendering of the control\nThe markup for the respective Bootstrap version must be implemented in the Boostrap-specific library. No custom styles should be implemented, instead the standard Bootstrap classes should be used. In individual exceptions, specific styles may be necessary for the controls. However, this is only permitted if there is no other option and no styles may be used for colour definitions and shapes.\nExample :graph TD\n    Common --> Boostrap3 --> DemoBootstrap3[Demo Boostrap 3];\n    Common --> Boostrap4 --> DemoBootstrap4[Demo Boostrap 4];\n    Common --> Boostrap5 --> DemoBootstrap5[Demo Boostrap 5];Run\nTo start the environment, 3 projects must be carried out.\nBootstrap 3\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap3: npm run run-bs3\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs3\n\nBootstrap 4\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap4: npm run run-bs4\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs4\n\nBootstrap 4\n\nStart Common: npm run run-common\nStart Boostrap5: npm run run-bs5\nStart Demo: npm run demo-bs5\n\nBuild\nTo create a build without a live update, the following commands can be executed\nCommon\nExample :npm run build-commonBootstrap 3\nExample :npm run build-bs3Bootstrap 4\nExample :npm run build-bs4Bootstrap 5\nExample :npm run build-bs5Documentation\nTo update all documentation, it is recommended to use the corresponding build command.

To do this, execute the following command.\nExample :npm run ngccBuild Pipeline\nRequirements\nThe following command must be executed for the Powershell script to be executed, Otherwise the following error is displayed:\nExample :./build.ps1 : File C:\\Daten\\jNetwork\\ch.jnetwork.angularcontrols\\build.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled    \non this system.
