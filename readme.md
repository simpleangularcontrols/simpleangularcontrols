## Contributors

This library is contributed by [jNetwork GmbH](https://www.jnetwork.ch) and [exanic AG](https://www.exanic.ch). The development of the library is not yet complete. Feature requests and bugs can be reported via GitHub Issues.


## Reason for the development

The idea is to create a library of controls as simple as possible, with which UI's can be created easily and quickly without having to worry about the markup. It is not the goal to cover 100% of the requirements. Special cases can easily be handled in a project and are not too complex when updating frameworks and components.
